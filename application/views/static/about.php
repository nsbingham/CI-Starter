	<p>I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--  In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. I'm trying not to, kid.</p>
	<p>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! I call it luck. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
	<p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. You mean it controls your actions? Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>
	<p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I find your lack of faith disturbing.</p>
	<p>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like...suicide.  Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Red Five standing by. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.</p>
